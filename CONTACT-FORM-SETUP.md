# Contact Form Setup Instructions

Your contact form is currently configured to use **Formspree** - a reliable service that sends form submissions directly to your email.

## Current Setup:

The form is already configured and ready to use! Messages will be sent to: **devdattasalunkhe0707@gmail.com**

### How it works:
1. Visitor fills out the contact form
2. Formspree sends the message to your Gmail
3. You receive an email with:
   - Visitor's name
   - Visitor's email
   - Their message
4. You can reply directly from your Gmail

### First Time Setup:
1. When someone submits the form for the first time, Formspree will send you a confirmation email
2. Click the confirmation link in that email
3. After confirmation, all messages will come through automatically

### What you'll receive:
```
From: Formspree <noreply@formspree.io>
To: devdattasalunkhe0707@gmail.com
Subject: [Satara Guide] New submission from your form

Name: John Doe
Email: john@example.com
Message: I want to visit Satara next month
```

## Alternative: FormSubmit (Previous Setup)

If you prefer FormSubmit, you need to:
1. Check your Gmail for "Form Activated" email
2. Click the activation link
3. After activation, messages will come through

## Testing:
1. Open your website
2. Fill out the contact form
3. Submit it
4. Check your Gmail inbox (and spam folder)
5. Confirm the email if it's the first submission

## Troubleshooting:
- **Not receiving emails?** Check spam/junk folder
- **Need to change email?** Update the form action URL
- **Want custom thank you page?** Add redirect URL in Formspree dashboard

## Current Configuration:
- Service: Formspree (https://formspree.io)
- Email: devdattasalunkhe0707@gmail.com
- Cost: Free (up to 50 submissions/month)
- Setup Time: 1 minute
- Verification: Required (one-time)
